        <h1>A ggplot2 heatmap function</h1>

<p>I have close to 20 years experience with base graphics in R/Splus. I can do almost anything I like, but <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">ggplot2</a> definitely wins on visually pleasing stakes. It's also a nice way of thinking about graphics, once you understand all the components. But it's also a whole other world. With base graphics, you can take multiple datasets in any shape, add bits and bobs together to get a plot. You don't have to mess with your data at all, but you may write many lines of plotting code. With ggplot2, the emphasis is more on getting your data in a sensible shape for plotting, and then doing the plot simply in a one liner. At least that is how it works for qplot, and the ability to facet easily without a loop is just lovely. In order to properly learn ggplot I have decided I will not use base graphics for a month.</p>

<p>The first plot I had to make after this decision was a heatmap. I toyed with using pheatmap which is very pretty, but decided that was breaking my promise on the first day. I couldn't find any good ggplot2 heatmap function either (one that showed dendrograms and heatmap). So I created one, and on the way learnt more than I thought I wanted to know about grid graphics and viewports.</p>

<p>It was also hard to find out exactly how to remove all axes etc using ggplot2. These links helped:</p>

<h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

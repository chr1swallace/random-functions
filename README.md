R functions for which I want some version control

Note, these are public because there's no point in making them private, but that doesn't mean they will be useful to you! You are welcome to give them a go and I always appreciate anyone spotting bugs in my code.

Perhaps one day they some of these functions will come together in proper R packages, no guarantee.

I keep some notes about these functions here: http://cwcode.wordpress.com

Functions

ggplot-heatmap.R makes heatmaps in ggplot2
